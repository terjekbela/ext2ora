## An Oracle backend for Sencha Ext JS grid component

I made this because Sencha did not include any meaningful backend example for it's Ext JS grid component.
It's storing data in Oracle using PHP on the backend, using the new REST API.

Sencha's grid component was/is an otherwise powerful tool for making simple maintenance grids for base data editing.
A customer application required a large number of relatively simple maintenance grids for a banking/financial app,
so I had to come up with something simple.

The company went out of business a long time ago, so I'm releasing this with GPLv2.
This is terribly outdated, but maybe still useful for somebody. Have fun!
